# Monthly Bills CLI script

This script helps add up and split monthly bills between different people. A report is generated
and saved into a text file.

## Use case

I created this script because I split bills between two other people in a home. But not all of us
contribute to each bill equally. So, I needed a way to easily calculate exactly how much each person is
contributing to each bill (if at all) and also have a report that I can save and track.

## How to use

- Download the raw script directly or fork this repo
- Make sure you have Python installed
- Run the script using `python monthly-bills-cli.py`
- Optional: Edit `.bashrc or .zshrc` to create an alias
