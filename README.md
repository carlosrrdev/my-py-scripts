# my-py-scripts

Personal collection of Python scripts to help me with every-day tasks, automation, and general qualify-of-life.

I am choosing to make this repo public in-case anyone wants to use any of my scripts, but be aware that I am not tailoring these scripts for open-source. Many (if not all) of these scripts may be completely useless to anyone other than myself. But you are more than welcome to take any of these scripts and modify them to suit your needs.
